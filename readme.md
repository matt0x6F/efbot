# efbot

efbot is a bot that exists on Libera.chat as a channel administration bot.

## Why?

I like tinkering on bot software. This bot is almost meant to track the release of tickets for [Electric 
Forest](https://electricforestfestival.com/), that meant some level of raw API access. Because of that, I chose to 
build a bot on a thin IRC framework rather than a full bot framework.

## Can I use this?

The project is released under permissive licensing, however, I haven't really made the project easy to hack on or 
reuse. If you don't mind asking questions or reading code this might be the right project for you.
